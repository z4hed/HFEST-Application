# HFEST-Application

The Health Facility Employee Status Tracking System (HFESTS) is a database system developed to help healthcare facilities keep track of their employeesâ€™ health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. This system is an extension of the application developed in the warm-up project, with new functionalities and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate user interaction with the system.

The HFESTS system maintains all the information about the employees of the facilities that are related to the pandemic, including information about infections and vaccinations. It also maintains the schedule of work for every employee, which is used to help the facilities reduce the risk of contamination between employees. The system is designed to provide facilities with an efficient and effective tool to manage their employees' health status, which is critical in the fight against COVID-19.
